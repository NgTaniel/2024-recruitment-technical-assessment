The submission is created using vite and react, the instructions are as follows:

1. Fork the repository

2. Clone the repository by inputting 'git clone <repo's http link>' and change directory using 'cd uni-task'

3. Input in the terminal 'npm run dev', then hover over the link (should look something like http://localhost:5173/) and 'ctrl + click'

4. The frontend page should appear in a new tab

Note: currently slightly modified the sampleData.tsx containing the items from course.json, where average stars have been rounded up to ensure proper display on the frontend
