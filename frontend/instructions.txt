Please detail the instructions to view your solution here:

The submission is created using vite and react, the instructions are as follows:

1. Fork the repository

2. Clone the repository by inputting 'git clone <repo's http link>' and change directory using 'cd 2024-recruitment-technical-assessment\frontend\uni-task'

3. Input in the terminal 'npm run dev', then hover over the link (should look something like http://localhost:5173/) and 'ctrl + click'

4. The frontend page should appear in a new tab

Notes: 

- Slightly modified the sampleData.tsx containing the items from courses.json, where average stars have been rounded up to ensure proper display on the frontend

- Created 'sampleData.tsx' to utilise the sampleData provided by courses.json, types.tsx is used for the type safety of keys

- Some icons or symbols used are different from what the image displays

- Whilst a responsive design is not accounted for, my recreation of the task is focused and developed using a laptop screen display rather than a PC Monitor display
- If viewed on a laptop: you may most likely need to scroll to see all the courses displayed
- If viewed on a PC monitor screen: the positioning of the icons of the sidebar as well as components such as the 'Sort by' button and searchbar may not be placed nor centered neatly
